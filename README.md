# Instagram-Filter

This is an exercise in matrix processing in python using functional programming.

The process of transforming each point into the average of its neighbors is a very common image filter. The big difference is in the size of the images, represented as collections of pixels (3 numbers representing the red, green, and blue components), because they are much larger than what you'll see here. By averaging the values, we remove details and edges, blurring the image. Therefore, this is a simplified version of a filter to eliminate open pores, wrinkles and crow's feet on instagram.
